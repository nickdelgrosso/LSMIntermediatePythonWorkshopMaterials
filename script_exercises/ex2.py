Exercise: Sequence Translator
-----------------------------

Your new dna sequencing program just produced sequence, but it is encoded in a strange way:

..---**-!.*

Reading the progam's manual, you learn that each symbol represents a different nucleotide:

. = Adenine
- = Cytosine
* = Thymine
! = Guanine

Write a program that translates and prints the letter code of this sequence.
