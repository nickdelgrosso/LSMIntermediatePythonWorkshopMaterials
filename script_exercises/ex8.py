Exercise: Differential Computer
-------------------------------

Write a program that reads a file with a mix of DNA and RNA sequences.
For each sequence:
  - If it is a  DNA sequence, print the total number of A and T
  - If it is an RNA sequence, print the total number of A and U

Each printed should contain both the calculate number and the sequence.  For example:

"ATTGAGAGAG" becomes "6 ATTGAGAGAG"
