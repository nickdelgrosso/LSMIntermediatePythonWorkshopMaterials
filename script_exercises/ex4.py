Exercise: Interactive Multi-Sequence GC Calculator
--------

Write a program that lets someone type in many dna sequences, seperated by spaces, 
then prints the percentages of G and C in *each* sequence.

For example:  GCATGATA GCCCAAAGTT GGGAAACCATA

Note: Here is an example of a for-loop:

for seq in ["GC", "AT", "GGT"]:
   print(seq)
